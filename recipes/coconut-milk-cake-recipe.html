    <h4>This is a super moist and tasty coconut cake</h4>
    <p>Growing up in Brazil, this was a <strong><em>favorite</em></strong> amongst our circle of friends.</p> 
    <p>It is especially good with a cup of coffee on the side. I've converted a few of my anti-coconut <em>family and friends into lovers of this cake.</em></p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
    <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
  </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
          <p></p>
      <li>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
          <p></p>
      <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture,<br>
        alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.</li>
          <p></p>
      <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or<br> 
        whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold<br> 
        egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
          <p></p>
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
