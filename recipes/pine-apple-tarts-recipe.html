    <h3>Festive cookie of Singapore</h3>
    <p>Pineapple Tarts or Kuih Tart in Malay, are the <em>personification of the festive cookie in Singapore and Malaysia</em>.</p> 
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>10 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>2 cups fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and shredded</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>4 whole cloves</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
  </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine all-purpose, self-rising flour and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br> 
          Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour in 1 beaten egg and water. Bind the ingredients together gently.<br> 
          Do not knead too much. Shape dough into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
          <p></p>
      <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine pineapple and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer,<br>
          stirring frequently, for 30 minutes, or until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>
          <p></p>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
          <p></p>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness.<br> 
          Cut 24 rounds, using a 2 inch round fluted cutter.<br> 
          Place on cookie sheet. Put a spoonful of pineapple jam in the center of each piece.<br>
          Decorate with criss-cross strips of pastry over jam, extending slightly onto pastry shell.</li>
          <p></p>
       <li>Cut 24 more 2 inch rounds, then, using a smaller cutter, cut out the centers, creating a ring shape.<br> 
            Moisten the edges of each pastry, and place the rings on top of each pastry shell. Brush the top of the pastry with beaten egg.</li>
          <p></p>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>    
  </ol>
